This project allows you to check the weather of a particular city for the current day and the next 5 days.

When it is opened for the first time, the weather data of the city in which the user is located is displayed, taking into account the coordinates. If the user does not grant permission to access their location, a banner is displayed indicating that they must provide such information.

The project was deployed through vercel and can be accessed through the following url:https://weather-jade-omega.vercel.app/
